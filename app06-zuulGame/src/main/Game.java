 * This class is the main class of the "World of Zuul" application. "World of
 * Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game. Users can walk around some
 * scenery. That's all. It should really be extended to make it more
 * interesting!
 * 
 * This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates the map,
 * creates the command invoker and starts the game.
